Real Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles Using Deep Learning

(1.1) Object detection for autonomous vehicles

Autonomous driving technologies aim at navigating the road network without human intervention by sensing and reacting to the vehicleâ€™s surrounding environment . This includes many challenges for Computer Vision and Deep Learning, such as object detection. Object detection is one of the most important requirements for autonomous navigation and consists of localization and classifcation of objects. Therefore, accurate object detection algorithms are needed. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning models that address the problem of object detection include Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) and their improved versions Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, designed for model performance and first introduced in 2013. A second model for object detection introduced in 2015 is YOLO, designed for speed and real-time use
